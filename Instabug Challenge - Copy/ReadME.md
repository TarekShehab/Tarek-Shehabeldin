# Instabug Challenge

## Part 1 & 2 [Manual Testing]
Regarding the Manual part of the challenge, I've organized everything in my google drive for convenience. You can find the drive folder [`here`](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VsZg1hFaaOevFVRjHihE9ZGcT9KKvl5e).

Before jumping into the drive, I'd like for the reviewer to note the following:
* The expected result for all the tests was assumed because there was no requirements provided with the task.
* In defects, there’s a “Screenshots” column. The defects that has a checked box will have one or more screenshot in the “Evidence” folder named by the defect’s ID (DID).
* Test cases are arranged in the sheet according to the possible business impact as specified in the requirements.

## Part 3 [Automation]:

Please note the following:
* Playright was the tool of choice for this task.
* Three Tests were automated
